# p5jsspeech - Siri for generative Art

Finally speech supported generative Art!
Based on the p5.js Speech Recognition

The Library doesn't run locally. 
The easiest way is to start a simple python server: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 in the project folder.

The program works in german or english.
Say into the microphone following parameters: a shape, a color and a size (not for lines) 
These are the 3 available shapes:
- kreis, circle
- quadrat, square
- linie, line

these are the 4 available colors:
- rot,red
- green (gr√ºn doesn't work cuz of some anoying umlaut stuff)
- blau, blue
- schwarz, black

the size can be any integer number

the shape is drawn at a random spot on the screen.

you can also scream zeichnen or draw to draw with only a subset of parameters or scream clear,start to clear the already set parameters.
